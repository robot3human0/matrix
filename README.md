## Historical background
>The first mentions of matrices (or as they were called then - "magic squares") were found in ancient China. 

>They became famous in the middle of the 18th century thanks to the work of the famous mathematician Gabriel Cramer, who published his work "Introduction to the Analysis of Algebraic Curves", which described a fundamentally new algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. 

>Soon after, the works of Carl Friedrich Gauss on the "classical" method of solving linear equations, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, the works of Karl Weierstrass, Georg Frobenius, and other outstanding scientists were published. 

>It was not until 1850 that James Joseph Sylvester introduced the term "Matrix" in his work.

>Matrices are one of the basic data structures in programming, e.g. they are used to represent table values, for computational tasks and neural networks. As part of the project you will learn more about matrices and solidify knowledge of structured programming.
